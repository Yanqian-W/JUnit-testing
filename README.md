# JUnit Testing

**Test-Driven Development:**
- Clarify code structure and class functionality and relationships
- Writing the test report
  - Document test result: pass or fail
  - If failed, document the cause, what was fixed, and when they then passed
  - Using proper comments
- Writing tests for the FBPlayer, FBTeam, and FBGame classes
- Integration Testing by building JUnit tests for the Main class
- Improving and fixing the code

**Quality of Tests:**
- Using a variety of types of assert (not just assert equals on everything)
- Parameterised tests
- Tests the aim for the logic in the functions (like if statements etc.)
